# ACH

Automated Cozy Hydrater (ACH *[ax]*) is a CLI that lets you create and remove documents in batches in your Cozy.

Install ACH by cloning the repo and running `npm i`.

Use it by running `node index.js` or `npm start` and let the help guide you!

Files provided to the `import` command are parsed by [dummy-json](https://github.com/webroo/dummy-json), so you can pass a template file instead of a straight up JSON if you like.
